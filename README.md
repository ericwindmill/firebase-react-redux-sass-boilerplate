## Firebase, React, Redux, Sass, Webpack


Bare-bones boiler plate users to make React-Redux apps quickly. This is essentially exactly what I use whenever a new app idea pops in my mind.

Includes
- React
- Redux
- Firebase integration (You need to set up your own key and insert it into the firebase.js file)
- Webpack
- Sass 

## Use it:
```
git clone https://github.com/ericwindmill/firebase-react-redux-sass-boilerplate

yarn install

yarn start
```
